 Training dataset and saving the model using deep learning cnn algorithm in tf-cut5-cnn-fashion.py file.
 Testing converted tflite model if it works in tf-cut5-try.py file.
 
 In android, I am only using MainActivity. For better output, load an 28x28 white outfit (t-shirt, coat, bag, ankle boot, etc.) on black background. Take the image from the gallery and you will see the selected image on the screen. Push on 'Classify' button _which is not working yet._
 
 When you push on 'Classify' button, on Logcat you will see an error while running tflite model where the image is sent as an input and waiting for an output. I couldn't solve it yet but when I do, I will update the codes. 
 
 *Please send me message if you can solve or have solved it until I do.*
